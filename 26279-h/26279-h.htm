SINGING AND MUSIC.</h1>

<p class="center">TO BE HAD AT FRIENDS' BOOK STORE,</p>

<p class="center">No. 304 Arch Street, Philadelphia.</p>

</div>

<div class="introduction">
<p>At a Yearly Meeting of Friends held in Philadelphia from
the 20th of the Fourth Month to the 24th of the same, inclusive,
1885.</p>

<p>An Essay on Singing and Music contained in the Minutes of
the Meeting for Sufferings was now read, setting forth the spiritual
nature of true worship, the danger of depending on outward forms
in religious meetings, and the disadvantages connected with the
practice of singing and music as an amusement. Much unity
was expressed with the essay, and it was concluded that it should
be published and distributed for information and warning to our
own members and others. Desires were felt that in thus issuing
a renewed testimony to the principles of our Society, we may be
individually aroused to the necessity of so living in communion
with the Father of Spirits, and in subjection to the revelations of
his Light in our hearts, that our meetings may truly be held
under the overshadowing of the Divine Power.</p>

<p>Taken from the Minutes.</p>

<p class="heading no-indent">On Singing and Music.</p>


<p>We have been brought under a feeling of religious
concern that the ancient testimony of the Society of
Friends to the true nature of spiritual worship may be
fully maintained by all who claim that name; and that
they may be watchful against the introduction of practices
which will undermine the support of this testimony,
and thus lead those who profess to be the children of the
Light, back into a dependence upon forms, out of which
their forefathers in the Truth were brought by that remarkable
outpouring of grace and spiritual power which
marked the rise of Friends as a distinct people.</p>

<p>The fundamental doctrine declared by our Saviour,
when He said, &#8220;It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh
profiteth nothing,&#8221; was steadily kept in view by George
Fox and his fellow laborers. They clearly saw that
Christ had ended the Jewish law, with its outward and
ceremonial observances, and had introduced a spiritual
dispensation, under which He, by his heavenly and eternal
Light or Spirit, was to be the Leader, Guide and Helper
of his people; that all was now to be done in and by Him;
and that this was especially true of religious worship, which
depends upon the enlightening, quickening power of his
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>All confidence in the flesh,&mdash;in the natural abilities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span>man,&mdash;was removed; and they were taught to distinguish
between that which is of man and that which is of God,&mdash;between
that stirring up of the natural feelings which
can be produced by the skilful use of outward means, such
as music, pictorial representations and architectural grace
and grandeur; and that solemn covering of the heart
which is a fruit and an evidence of the extension of Divine
help and power.</p>

<p>Hence these divinely enlightened men and women laid
aside the forms in which they had been educated, and
which many of them had sincerely and zealously practised,
and, in their private retirements before the Lord, and when
they assembled for the performance of public worship, they
sat in silence before Him, seeking to draw near in spirit,
in living exercise of mind, that they might feel the arising
of his power, and be enabled to offer acceptable worship.</p>

<p>As that power arose in any, and under its influence,
they were led to utter words of prayer or praise to the
Almighty, or exhortation to their fellow believers; they
were comforted or edified in proportion as they could feel
the Spirit bearing witness to the life that accompanied the
vocal expressions. Thus their dependence was not placed
on man, but on the Spirit that quickeneth.</p>

<p>There was no desire to limit the operation of the Spirit,
or to lay down any rule which would prohibit in times of
worship any act which truly proceeded from its motions;
but there was a jealous care that none of these outward
things should be done as formal matters; that people
should not look upon them as essential to the holding of
meetings for worship, and that they should not in any
manner be led away from their dependence on the fresh
extension of Divine life and light to their souls, as the very
foundation of true worship. The writings of the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">5</a></span>members of our Society abound in evidences of their watchful
care in this respect.</p>

<p>Among them, one of the most earnest and effective
laborers for the spread of the Gospel, was Edward Burrough,
whose efforts in London were blessed to a large
number. Over the converts in that city he watched with
anxious love; and, when absent in the service of his Master
in other parts, frequently visited them by epistles, in
which he gave much sound and practical advice. From
these epistles are taken the following passages, referring
to the manner in which these meetings for worship were
to be held.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We charge and command you in the presence of the
Lord, whose power is dreadful, that you meet together in
silence, and wait, and none to speak a word but what he
is moved to speak, a word from the Lord.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>E. Burrough's
Works, Ed.&nbsp;1672, p.&nbsp;70.</cite></p>

<p>&#8220;We charge by the Lord that none speak without eternal
[Divine] motion; for if you do, the false prophet
speaks, and his words eat as a canker, and darken and vail
them that hearken to it.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Id., p.&nbsp;71.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>The nature of this spiritual worship is clearly portrayed
by Robert Barclay; see the 11th Proposition of his Apology,
particularly in Sections 6 and 7, to which we desire the
reader to refer.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We have viewed with much concern the gradual creeping
into the meetings of Friends, in some parts of the
country, of latter years, of reading the Scriptures, and of
singing, practices which, until within a few years, were almost
unknown amongst us.</p>

<p>We believe that these changes are an evidence of a departure
from that dependence on the Lord for ability to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6">6</a></span>worship Him aright, which was so conspicuous a testimony
of this Society; and that they are connected with a shrinking
from patient waiting upon the Lord, and from the
humbling exercise of mind which is often felt in endeavoring
to draw near in spirit to Him.</p>

<p>Friends do not assemble in their meetings for Divine
worship for the sake of listening to any outward performances.
If this principle is once departed from, there is no
tenable ground to prevent a gradual lapse into a full
adoption of those forms out of which our Society was
brought in the beginning. If the Scriptures are to be
read in our meetings, how easy is it to conclude that a
careful selection, such as is provided in the liturgies of
some religious bodies, would be preferable to the choice
likely to be made by persons of less education, or who
have given less time and thought to the subject. If singing
by tune is to be practised, why should not the highest
style of art, aided by musical instruments, be made use of,
so as more effectively to stimulate the emotions of the
listeners? If preaching is essential to the proper holding
of a meeting, it may be asked, would it not be better to
employ persons of marked ability, who have been regularly
trained to such an employment, and who may reasonably
be supposed to be better prepared than others to interest
and instruct an audience? If vocal prayer is always
in place, without regard to the immediate promptings of
Him who only knows the conditions and needs of those
assembled, it might be asked, why not use some of those
beautiful and comprehensive forms which are found in the
prayer-books of other societies?</p>

<p>Thus, there is reason to fear, the language of the prophet
might become applicable to our Society. &#8220;I had
planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7">7</a></span>art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange
vine unto me?&#8221;</p>

<hr/>

<p>We think the danger we have endeavored to point out
is peculiarly great as respects music and singing, owing to
the power over the natural sensibilities, which sweet sounds
possess; and it is easy to mistake the emotions thus produced
for the tenderness of mind and the softening influence
of &#8220;the Spirit that quickeneth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The distinction between these is very clearly pointed out
by the late Thomas Chalmers, a distinguished clergyman
of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, a man eminent
for his abilities, and whose position gave him abundant
opportunities for observing that of which he speaks. He
says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;You easily understand how a taste for music is one
thing, and a real submission to the influence of religion is
another; how the ear may be regaled by the melody of
sound, and the heart may utterly refuse the proper impression
of the sense that is conveyed by it; how the sons and
daughters of the world may, with their every affection devoted
to its perishable vanities, inhale all the delights of
enthusiasm, as they sit in crowded assemblage, around the
deep and solemn oratorio.&#8221; &#8220;It is a very possible thing,
that the moral and the rational and the active man, may
have given no entrance into his bosom for any of the sentiments,
and yet so overpowered may he be by the charm
of vocal conveyance through which they are addressed to
him, that he may be made to feel with such an emotion,
and to weep with such a tenderness, and to kindle with
such a transport, and to glow with such an elevation, as
may one and all carry upon them the semblance of sacredness.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Chalmers'
Works, Phila., 1830, p.&nbsp;107&ndash;8.</cite></p>

<p>In speaking of the connection between music and worship,
another person, not a member of the Society of Friends,
observes: &#8220;I firmly believe&#8221; &#8220;that if we seek to affect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8">8</a></span>the mind by the aid of architecture, painting or music, the
impression produced by these adjuncts is just so much subtracted
from the worship of the unseen Jehovah. If the
outward eye is taken up with material splendor, or forms
of external beauty, the mind sees but little of Him who is
invisible; the ear that is entranced with the melody of
sweet sounds, listens not to the still small voice by which
the Lord makes his presence known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True spiritual access unto God,&#8221; says another writer,
&#8220;is not at all furthered by the excitement of the animal
or intellectual frame. It is most commonly known, where
in abstraction from outward things, the mind, in awful
quietude, finds itself gathered into a sense of the presence
of Infinite Purity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the power of imagination; by the influence of eloquent
words; by a stirring swell of elevated music, the
mind may be excited; the feelings may be tendered, and
we may pour forth verbal supplication, whilst the heart is
unchanged.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Edward Burrough thus instructively describes the
changes which followed the declension of the primitive
church from its original state of life and purity.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the gift of the ministry through the Holy Ghost
was lost and no more received, men began to make ministers
by learning arts and languages and human policy.
They began to study from books and writings what to
preach, not having the Holy Ghost, without which none
are the ministers of Christ.&#8221; &#8220;Having lost the sense of
God's true worship, which is in spirit and in truth, they
began to worship in outward observances, which is not
the worship of God, but superstitious and idolatrous.&#8221;
&#8220;When singing in the spirit and with the understanding
ceased, then people began to introduce the form of singing
David's experiences, in rhyme and metre; and thus,
in the apostacy, the form grew as a substitute for that
which the saints had enjoyed in power; shadows were set
up instead of the substance, and death instead of life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9">9</a></span>
The same writer in an appeal to the professors of his
day to test their religious profession by the Scriptures,
says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Likewise you sing and give to sing David's psalms in
rhyme and metre, professing it is to the glory and honor
of God. Ye practise this as an ordinance of God, as a
part of his worship, and as a part of your religion; but
this practice and profession also are manifest not to be
according to the Scriptures; because it was never commanded;
neither is there any precedent for this practice
in the Scriptures in gospel times.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Robert Barclay says, &#8220;We confess this [singing of
Psalms] to be a part of God's worship, and very sweet
and refreshing when it proceeds from a true sense of God's
love in the heart, and arises from the Divine influence of
the spirit.&#8221; But he condemns &#8220;the formal, customary
way of singing,&#8221; which was practised by professors in his
day, and has been continued down to the present time, as
having &#8220;no foundation in Scripture, nor any ground in
true Christianity.&#8221; He concludes his remarks on this
subject in the following words: &#8220;As to their artificial
music, either by organs or other instruments, or voice, we
have neither example nor precept for it in the New Testament.&#8221;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Independently of that harmony of sound which is the
result of musical skill, there is a modulation of the voice
which is an index of the feelings of the mind. Where
the heart is melted under a sense of Divine goodness and
love, and thanksgiving to the Author of all our blessings
flows from it, true melody is often shown in the tones of
the voice; and this is sometimes apparent even when no
words are distinctly uttered. It is to such a state of mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span>we understand the Apostle Paul to refer when he speaks
to the Ephesians, of &#8220;making melody in your heart to the
Lord.&#8221; When an outward harmony, depending upon
&#8220;invented tunes, such as please the carnal mind,&#8221; and
upon words which have been committed to memory in
order to be sung therewith, takes the place of that expression
which comes from the heart and is uttered under
a sense of the Divine requiring, then those who take part
therein fall into that &#8220;formal,&#8221; &#8220;customary,&#8221; &#8220;artificial&#8221;
way of singing, against which the Society of Friends has
borne a steady testimony from its rise.</p>

<hr/>

<p>These observations apply to vocal religious exercises in
the family as well as in more public gatherings.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We believe the tendency of this artificial music on the
mind, even when attuned to the expression of religious
sentiment, and accompanied by the language of Divine
worship, is to &#8220;lead the soul almost insensibly to substitute
a pleasing emotion which ends in self, for those spiritual
sacrifices which are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,
even a broken and contrite heart, and that communion
with the Father and the Son which results from loving
God and keeping his commandments.&#8221;</p>

<hr/>

<p>In congregational singing, there is an added inconsistency.
For, it is in the highest degree improbable that
those assembled on such occasions will be in such a frame
of mind as will fit them properly and truthfully to join
in the offering of the prayers or praises expressed in the
hymns which may be given out to be sung. This objection
is pointed out by Barclay in his Apology, where,
after stating that &#8220;the formal customary way of singing
hath no foundation in Scripture, nor any ground in true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>Christianity,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;all manner of wicked, profane
persons take upon them to personate the experiences and
conditions of blessed David; which are not only false as
to them, but also to some of more sobriety, who utter them
forth.&#8221; &#8220;Such singing doth more please the carnal ears
of men, than the pure ears of the Lord, who abhors all
lying and hypocrisy.&#8221; (<cite>Prop. XI, sect. 26.</cite>)</p>

<p>This difficulty has been felt by many sincere persons
who were not members of our Society, and has prevented
some of them from joining in such performances. John
Spalding, while still a member of the established Church
of England, was so convinced of its inconsistency, that he
addressed a letter to those who met at the place of worship
which he was accustomed to attend, in which he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I appeal to the witness of God in every heart, considering
the variety of conditions, the different subjects of
praise, adoration, confession, petitioning, &amp;c., contained in
every collection of hymns, whether in the fear of the
Lord any one, in whatever state or condition he may be
at the time, can with propriety be ready to sing whatever
may be given out.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Spalding further testifies as to the effect of formal
singing in worship. &#8220;From my own experience I can
say it has a tendency to divert the mind from solemn, serious
reflections. I am now speaking more particularly
concerning those, who have attained to a measure of the
grace of God. Ask yourselves, is outward singing intended
or calculated to please the carnal ears of men, or a
holy God? Why such anxiety about tunes, voices, and
music? Is the Lord to be pleased with such poor things?
Oh, no, you cannot suppose it. Consider from what root
it springs; from the old man or the new; and remember
the axe is laid to the root to destroy all that is of the earth,
of our fleshly nature. I have considered those passages
in the New Testament where the subject is mentioned, and
am confirmed by them in my opinion of the inconsistency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">12</a></span>of public singing. The apostle speaks of singing with
grace in the heart; of making melody in the heart to the
Lord, not making a noise with the tongue, unless that
proceeds from the heart.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In a Memorial concerning Edward Cobb of Maine, issued
by Falmouth Monthly Meeting, there is preserved
some account of his religious experience before he became
a member of the Society of Friends, which took place in
1797. In this he states:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;When quite young, I learned the rules and was very
fond of what is called sacred music, sparing no pains to
attend schools for that purpose; and the prayer of my
heart to be directed aright regarding worship, seemed to
receive the first intelligible answer by the way of reproof
in this exercise; and when, at the head of a choir of singers,
words have occurred that, through the enlightening
influence of heavenly goodness, (which had long been
operating on my mind), appeared evidently inconsistent
with my own state, I have often, to be unobserved by the
company, kept the tune along; while I feared that taking
the words into my mouth, and uttering them as worship
to Him who requires worship of his creature man in spirit
and in truth, could be nothing short of solemn mockery
from that mind which had been so far enlightened as to
believe that nothing could be acceptable worship to Almighty
God but what came from Him, and, through the
medium of his own Spirit, was breathed out to Him
again as that Spirit should dictate, whether in prayer or
in praises to his great name.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In confirmation of the fact that those who were convinced
of the principles of Friends, when they joined in
membership, were constrained to lay aside their former
practices of reading and singing in meetings for Divine
worship, it may be mentioned, that although the writings
of those who were mainly instrumental in gathering the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13">13</a></span>Society at the time of its rise, contain many advices, cautions
and encouragements to its members, as to the exercise
of the ministry, and as to worship, yet they are almost
totally silent as to these practices.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In expressing these views, our object is to guard our
own members from sliding into the adoption of views
and practices which are inconsistent with, and lead away
from the standard of spiritual religion and worship believed
in by us, and thus cause us to lose that post in his
militant church which was assigned us by its Holy Head.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We have been concerned also at the increase of instruments
of music and the practice of singing in the families of
our members, as a means of amusement. Even under the
Jewish dispensation a woe was pronounced upon those
who in a wanton and unconcerned state of mind invented
unto themselves instruments of music like David, but who
were not grieved for the afflictions of Joseph&mdash;that is, for
the exercises and sufferings of the righteous seed.</p>

<p>George Fox declares that he was led to cry out against
all sorts of music; and the advices of our Society down to
modern times have been uniformly in the same direction.
It has been felt that the time required to become a proficient
in its practice was improperly taken from more important
uses; that the emotions it produces have no tendency
to strengthen the intellectual or moral character;
that the most melodious sounds that human instruments
can make have no power to implant principles, give
strength to resist temptation or eradicate selfishness; that
the love of music often leads into associations which are
corrupting in their character, as is shown by its use in
promoting the frivolity of the ball-room, and the dissipation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14">14</a></span>of the drinking-saloon, and especially in exciting the
passions and drowning the sensibilities of those engaged in
the awful conflicts of the battle-field; and that it is often
resorted to to dispel the feelings of sadness and inquietude
which are spread over the mind at times by the Holy
Spirit, and are the merciful visitations of our compassionate
Redeemer, designed to draw the thoughts away from
earthly things, and to fix them upon the alone Source of
never ending happiness. Instead of quietly and patiently
abiding under these dispensations, with the mind stayed
on the Lord, in order to experience their full benefit, if
any of these visited ones should resort to instruments of
music and other means of dissipating the impressions on
their minds, it will be likely to mar the blessing designed
by this extension of the mercy of God to their souls.</p>

<p>The same kind of reasoning, which would defend the
use of music and singing as amusements, may also be urged
in support of dancing, attending theatrical exhibitions, and
other indulgences, which, in the aggregate, distinguish the
man of the world from the self-denying follower of Christ.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 120px; page-break-after: always;">We desire, therefore, renewedly to call the attention of
Friends to this subject; and to caution them against indulging
themselves or their families in any practice, however
pleasing to the natural taste, which will weaken their
hands in supporting in its purity our ancient testimony to
the nature of spiritual worship; or which will have the
effect of retarding their own progress in the self-denying
path that leads to the kingdom of heaven.</p>
